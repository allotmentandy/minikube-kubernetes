# Learning Minikube, Kubernetes, Docker
---

This repo is a collection of notes and projects I have found across the web as I learn kubernetes with minikube. 

I am looking for small footprint projects which explain to me the ways to get different ways of building kubernetes clusters from the tutorials linked.

I am coming from a PHP webserver background, but also would like to get Golang, python, bash, rust and other languages in the mix.


1st - goHtmlServer
